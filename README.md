3MM Ball Lens holder for the iPhone 4/4s (Microscope)

A recent article highlighted that an iPhone microscope could save some 600m lives in Africa. The plan is to build an Open-Source 3D printed holder for this lens to clip on an iPhone. This would cheaply allow doctors in these areas to either print of have printed a lens holder to quickly clip the lens on without the worry of losing it.
